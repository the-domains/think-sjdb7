The light perception is just a mean to an end.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="109"><p data-reactid="110">Consequently, Daniel Kish&#x27;s brain unconsciously explored other senses to configure them in a way that they would be able to project in the brain the same perception that sight provides.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="111"><p data-reactid="112">Said otherwise, Daniel Kish&#x27;s unconscious brain solved the problem, providing the ability to perceive the space.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="113"><p data-reactid="114">Outside of the conscious thinking, Daniel Kish&#x27;s brain had no preconceptions; it did not &quot;think&quot; that because the human hearing apparatus does not resemble in any way the visual apparatus they could not have similar functions?</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="115"><p data-reactid="116">One explanation of Daniel Kish&#x27;s unconscious mind success could be that it had no preconceptions; it just &quot;focused&quot; in finding a solution without excluding any possibility.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="117"><p data-reactid="118">Preconceptions are forerunners in forming a concept.
